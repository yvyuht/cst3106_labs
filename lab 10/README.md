# Hospital Triage App Design Document

## Design Overview
The Hospital Triage App is poised to deliver an intuitive interface, ensuring a seamless experience for both patients and administrative staff in navigating and managing the emergency room process. Emphasizing paramount design principles, the application will prioritize ease of use, accessibility, and operational efficiency.

## Fonts
- **Arial**: Arial is a sans-serif font, which is often considered more readable on digital screens, making Arial a suitable choice for websites where clarity is crucial. Also, Arial is a widely used font and is available on most operating systems and web browsers. Choosing a font that is familiar to a broad audience ensures a consistent and comfortable reading experience for users. 
- **Times New Roman**: Times New Roman has a clean and neutral design, making it a safe and straightforward option for conveying information on a formal website.  Times New Roman is often associated with printed documents, especially in academic and professional settings. Using it on a website may create a connection to the conventions of printed materials, contributing to a sense of reliability and credibility.

## Colour Palette
  - ** Grey Blue #C3CBD6 **: Used for primary buttons and headings to create a soothing environment for patients.
  - **Grey Green #748D6F **: Used for background elements to reduce visual strain.

## App Components

## Layout and Navigation

## Component Integration
- The **titles**, **description**, and **questionnaire** for the user page, along with the **admin summary** and action buttons on the admin page, will be thoughtful design. This design aims to guarantee that users can effortlessly comprehend and explore the app, optimizing the triage process for maximum efficiency.
